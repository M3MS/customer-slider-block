# ACF Customer Slider Block
### Example of Gutemberg block using ACF-Builder by Stoutlogic (Bedrock - Sage).

You'll need glidejs and to add the directory to your compiler, for example like this (with larevel-mix):
```
mix.alias({
    '@blocks': path.join(__dirname, 'app/includes/ACF/Blocks'),
});
```
